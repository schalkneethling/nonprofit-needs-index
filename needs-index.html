                    every year to assist with care giving and attempt to improve social
                    competence and behavior, it provides opportunity for growth and a
                    wider experience for our children with learning difficulty, mood
                    disorders and disabilities.</p>
                <p>Registered with social development as a NPO but we do not receive a

                    qualify for a government allowance. All fundraising activities have
                    been affected. During the lockdown we did not take in children and had
                    given to parents payment holidays. Any assistance is welcome but
