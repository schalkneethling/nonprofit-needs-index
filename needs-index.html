                <p>Jacobus Harding is the admin manager at Exodus Care Center. The center
                    has been around now for 38 years. The care center currently takes care
                    of 55 people which is a combination of school children, elderly and
                    unemployed individuals.</p>

                <p>Because of the lockdown and the related challenges of Covid-19 our
                    financial support, which allows us to purchase food and other
                    necessities for the people we serve. We are a registered NGO but even
                    so, we do not qualify to receive any financial support from the
                    Government.</p>

                <p>In the past, we were able to provide people with three healthy meals a
                    day, but at the moment, we find it hard to even provide two meals with
                    the little bit of food we can scrape together.</p>

                <p>Our immediate needs therefore are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Any donations of food. No donation is too small.</li>
                    <li>Any form of financial assistance</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Thank you so much and may God bless you and your family.</p>
